## About The Project

This component has some interesting CSS challenges in the design. If you're looking to test your CSS skills, this will be a great project for you!

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

This was great for practicing more of the HTML and CSS box model, flex, and sharpening my skills for responsive design. I did also add a little javascript for the slider instead of it just being a static design.
